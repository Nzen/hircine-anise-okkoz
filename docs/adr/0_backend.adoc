Status : accepted

== Context

What language should we implement the modules that communicate with Auto-Traffic-Control with ?

== Decision

Java. I am most comfortable with java and the point of this is to learn about grpc and not some language that I barely (go-lang) or don't at all (clojure) know.

== Deciders

* Nicholas Prado

== Consequences

People hoping for some other language may either need to read it carefully or may not refer to this project at all.

Anyone hoping to run haokkoz itself will need a jre.
