== Show Map

* assignee : Nicholas Prado
* status : to do
* priority : medium

Retrieve the map from the game and show it in some form, to visually validate success.

Consider letting the viewing person choose the visual elements to show: flight plan, legend of airplanes.
The latter assumes a different icon for each airplane.
