== Show Map

* assignee : Nicholas Prado
* status : in progress
* priority : medium

Retrieve the map from the game and show it in some form, to visually validate success.

Consider letting the viewing person choose the visual elements to show: flight plan, legend of airplanes.
The latter assumes a different icon for each airplane.

Shows the nodes, airports, and initial node of arriving airplanes.
This still needs to show updated flight plans, when they change via the simulation or haokkoz.
I'll put this on hold to work on i20220918.
