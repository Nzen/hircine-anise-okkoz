The effort to treat points within a distance to a particular map node should expense to this issue, rather than i20220823.

Is this fast enough to ask for all the map node points ?
Should I just put everything in a priority queue and weight based on whether an airplane is there or has a flight path in that direction ?
What a pain that didn't need to be put on the client.

.  uses/hao/ParcelMap
.  app/service/MapsNodePixels
.  saving new map creates a 'parcel map' message
.  queue from mapcache to mapsnodepixels (or is it to map service ?)
