Currently, the program operates naively.
It runs for a fixed amount of time, independent of whether the game has ended.
Not exiting is fine, provided there were some way to start a new game.
Exiting after a fixed amount of time isn't really fine.

Now that Haokkoz connects to a websocket, it can listen for messages about quitting and starting a game.
